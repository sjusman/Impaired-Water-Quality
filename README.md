# ImpairedWaterQuality
Therefore, the objective of this project is to assess the prevalence of contaminants that fall below regulatory thresholds and predict “non-detectable” values in the periodic water contaminant reports. The challenge is to decide how to interpret these non-detect values, and they cannot be assumed to be zero. We retrieve reports from the Environmental Working Group website and train the predictor with machine learning techniques. The training data set is a subset of the whole data set which contains only values under the respective minimum reporting limits. Our Random Forest model has a 0.93 R 2 value on the validation data set.
